**SimpleTorrent** is a a self-hosted remote torrent client, written in Go (golang). Started torrents remotely, download sets of files on the local disk of the server, which are then retrievable or streamable via HTTP.

# Features

This fork adds new features to the original cloud-torrent by `jpillora`.

* Run extrenal program on tasks completed: `DoneCmd`
* Stops task when seeding ratio reached: `SeedRatio`
* Download/Upload speed limiter: `UploadRate`/`DownloadRate`
* Detailed transfer stats in web UI.
* [Torrent Watcher](https://github.com/boypt/simple-torrent/wiki/Torrent-Watcher)
* K8s/docker health-check endpoint `/healthz`
* Extra trackers add from http source
* Protocol Handler to `magnet:`

And some development improvement:
* Go modules introduced and compatiable with go 1.12+
* Updated and compatiable with torrnet engine API from [anacrolix/torrent](https://github.com/anacrolix/torrent)

Also:
* Single binary
* Cross platform
* Embedded torrent search
* Real-time updates
* Mobile-friendly
* Fast [content server](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeContent)
* IPv6 out of the box

## Configuration file

A sample json will be created on the first run of simple-torrent.

```json
{
  "AutoStart": true,
  "Debug": false,
  "ObfsPreferred": true,
  "ObfsRequirePreferred": false,
  "DisableTrackers": false,
  "DisableIPv6": false,
  "DownloadDirectory": "/home/ubuntu/Workdir/cloud-torrent/downloads",
  "WatchDirectory": "/home/ubuntu/Workdir/cloud-torrent/torrents",
  "EnableUpload": true,
  "EnableSeeding": true,
  "IncomingPort": 50007,
  "DoneCmd": "",
  "SeedRatio": 1.5,
  "UploadRate": "High",
  "DownloadRate": "Unlimited",
  "TrackerListURL": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngosang/trackerslist/master/trackers_best.txt"
}
```

* `AutoStart`: Whether start torrent task on added Magnet/Torrent.
* `Debug` Print debug log from torrent engine (lots of them)
* `ObfsPreferred`: Whether torrent header obfuscation is preferred.
* `ObfsRequirePreferred`: Whether the value of `ObfsPreferred` is a strict requirement. This hides torrent traffic from being censored.
* `DisableTrackers`: Don't announce to trackers. This only leaves DHT to discover peers.
* `DisableIPv6`: Don't connect to IPv6 peers.
* `DisableEncryption` A switch disables [BitTorrent protocol encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_protocol_encryption)
* `DownloadDirectory` The directory where downloaded file saves.
* `WatchDirectory` The directory SimpleTorrent will watch and load new added `.torrent`, See [Torrent Watcher](https://github.com/boypt/simple-torrent/wiki/Torrent-Watcher)
* `EnableUpload` Whether send chunks to peers
* `EnableSeeding` Whether upload even after there's nothing further for us. By default uploading is not altruistic, we'll only upload to encourage the peer to reciprocate.
* `IncomingPort` The port SimpleTorrent listens to.
* `DoneCmd` An external program to call on task finished. See [DoneCmd Usage](https://github.com/boypt/simple-torrent/wiki/DoneCmdUsage).
* `SeedRatio` The ratio of task Upload/Download data when reached, the task will be stop.
* `UploadRate`/`DownloadRate` The global speed limiter, a fixed level amoung `Low`(~50k/s), `Medium`(~500k/s) and `High`(~1500k/s) is accepted as value, all other values (or empty) will result in unlimited rate.
* `TrackerListURL`: A https URL to a trackers list, this option is design to retrive public trackers from [ngosang/trackerslist](https://github.com/ngosang/trackerslist). If configred, all trackers will be added to each torrent task.

## Systemd example

Below is an example of a service for Simple Torrent located in `/cloud-torrent` with `cloud-torrent` as user

```
[Unit]
Description=Cloud-Torrent on port 3000

[Service]
ExecStart=/cloud-torrent/Cloud-Torrent -t MySimpleTorrentWebPage -h 127.0.0.1 -p 3000 -a USER:PASSWORD -c /cloud-torrent/cloud-torrent.json
Restart=always
RestartSec=15
User=cloud-torrent

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

You can create it with `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/Simple-Torrent.service`

Start it with `sudo systemctl start Simple-Torrent`

Enable it at boot with `sudo systemctl enable Simple-Torrent`
